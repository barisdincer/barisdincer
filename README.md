👋 Hello! I am Barış Dinçer, a Jr. Data Scientist and a student majoring in Management Information Systems, exploring my passion for data science and software development. I am dedicated to enhancing my skills in the world of data.

🧠 I have knowledge in data science, statistics, and machine learning, gaining experience through various projects. Proficient in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, I specialize in data manipulation, analysis, and modeling.

🚀 With Flutter and project management training from the Google Academy, I have acquired experience in mobile app development. Embracing Agile methodology, I collaborated with my team to create a book application, featuring functions for users to search, save, and rate books.
